# Suggested Commands

## Development
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start dev server (http://localhost:3045)
npm run build        # Production build
npm start            # Start production server
```

## Windows-specific Commands
Since this is a Windows environment:
- Use `dir` instead of `ls` for listing files
- Use `cd` for navigation
- Use `type` instead of `cat` for file content
- Git commands work as usual
